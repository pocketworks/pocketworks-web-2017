          <blockquote>Businesses of all sizes want test new ideas, so you don't have to be a startup to get value from our lean approach to developing digital products. We encourage customers to let us move quickly and help them learn what works in the real world. Often this means keeping initial costs down so budget can be later invested in ideas that are proven to work.</blockquote>
