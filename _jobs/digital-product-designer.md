## How we see design

Do you believe the best digital products come from collaboration and iteration? Taking steps to create empathy with audiences is hugely important to designing successful products? Do you understand how to take quantative data and feed it into future product iterations?

If so, you might be a good for for who we're looking for.

We like to move quickly and pragmatically; finding the fastest and leanest ways to create success for our clients without compromising the integrety of our design processes.

Right now we're not perfect in our design practices but want to raise the bar. We hope you can help.

## The Role

We're looking for a digital product designer who's experienced with both user experience design and user interface design.

You'll work on many native iOS and Droid mobile applications, and a good few web apps too. Many of our clients are startups so there are a few nice "blank slate" projects. We're also expecting to work with chat bots requiring conversational interfaces before too long.

You'll help the team create better products by introducing more design practices. Right now, we're looking to embrace practices from IDEO's Human Centered Design and Google Design Sprints, so you're role will be to facilitate that.

You'll be required to work directly with clients sometimes, and also getting out in the field for research.

## What you'll be working on

Pocketworks designs and develops modern software products involving any modern technologies such as mobile, conversational interfaces, web, wearables and IoT. We work for a variety of clients on a wide range of products. From Uber-like taxi apps, to smart warehouse safety platforms, to small startup ventures. It's a fun mix.

The role would involve leading customer interviews and workshops, helping to shape the design processes going forward, and creating experiences that work for users.

If you join us, you’ll be designing digital products for a mixture of startups and established companies. The startup stuff is fun because you get to have a blank canvas, and potentially see the product grow. The established products are cool because you get to improve products used my 100,000+ users.

## Ideally you'd...

* Have experience in *concept validation and user testing*
* Have experience in research and ideation
* Enjoy *designing for outcomes*, and know about User Stories or even better, Jobs to be Done
* Have enough solutions experience to know how to tackle a wide *variety of design challenges*
* Don’t mind *sharing your crappy lo-fi sketches* or putting them on the walls to discuss
* Prefer to make *decisions on data* rather than heuristics. We do accept that gut feeling/left brain is also important.
* Love creating *modern mobile and web experiences* incorporating advances in browser and mobile technology.
* Like to set your own *processes and influence* those adopted by our team
* Are happy working with a multi-disciplined *Scrum* team, combining engineering and design skills to create better products

* *Learn constantly* about your profession. Attend events. And like sharing stuff on Slack/Twitter whatever (nice to have)
