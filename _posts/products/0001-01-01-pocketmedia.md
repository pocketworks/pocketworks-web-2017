  text: For over four years, we've been helping companies use iPads as a tool for
    supporting face to face sales. We've learnt that each company is different;
    they adapt their sales to their own offering and market position. Because of
    this, PocketMEDIA is designed to be adapted to each company, allowing teams
    to sell in the most effective way possible.
