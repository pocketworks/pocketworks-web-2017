We analysed data from 15,000 sales meetings to see if we could find a link between sales rep mood, and the sales revenues of the company.

This graph shows the mood of a sales team over 2 years. More specifically, it depicts *positivity*. The higher the line on the graph, the more positive the team are.

**Sales team positivity at any given time**

So, you can see spirits were high in June 2013, but not in January 2013. This was based on averages from 40 reps around the UK working for the same company over 2 years.

### How we get the data

This information was obtained *automatically* using data the company already had in their CRM. So if you're sales team use a CRM, then you have all the data you need to obtain this kind on intel.

We used *sentiment analysis* on every call note recorded by a sales rep over two years. Our sentiment analysis program reads each call note and judges it based on the words and launguage used. The result is a score which indicates how positive the language used was.

Because we can automate this, it's possible to produce a weekly report showing how positive the team are, which can then be used in many ways.

### Sales reps are miserable, then a month later sales are lower

It's no surprise that when sales reps appear to be less positive, the resultant sales figures are lower. This is the pattern we saw. If reps appear negative, then we see a downward trend in actual sales revenues in the following months. And if reps are positive, sales figures go up.

But what's interesting here is that we're using technology to analyse the figures, so it's possible to get early warning of sales based on mood a month before. If the data shows the sales team are negaive, then sales may be about to take a dip. So potentially our customer could look at this data on a weekly basis and take preventative action as overall mood drops.

### Next steps

If you've got any CRM data you'd like us to analyse, get in touch. We're interesting in trying this technology in the field to see if can be used for real benefit.
