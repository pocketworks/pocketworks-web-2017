We took a trip out to see our friends at Energenie exhibiting at the April 2015 Gadget Show in Birmingham, where they're launching their Mi&#124;Home range of smart home control products (electrical sockets, radiator valves and light switches).

Seeing them display their cool hardware and apps was pretty cool...

The apps allow Energenie customers to control their homes from their pocket.

Check out the features on the [Mi&#124;Home website](https://energenie4u.co.uk/index.phpmihome/the_range).

This is Energenie's most ambitious project yet. They're arranging distribution via some of the UK's biggest retailers, and Amazon of course.

## Customer play pen

In this showroom, customers can use to explore the Mi&#124;Home product range in person.

The showroom has all their hardware devices available for customers to play with. They can use a tablet to control each device in the showroom using an app. For example, then can...

* Turn a lamp on and off using a Mi&#124;Home plug adaptor
* Controlling a radiator using the Mi&#124;Home radiator valves
* Switching devices plugged into a Mi&#124;Home 4-gang plug socket
* Using the app to control an in-wall light switch
