grid-title: RackEye - creating a safer, more intelligent warehouse
case-study-challenge: 'A-Safe are always innovating, and wanted to take a ground-breaking
  concept to market. This product would help warehouses be safer by using state of
  the art technology to detect and alert when trucks collide with racking. With customers
  such as Coca Cola, BOSH and Jaguar, A-Safe needed to work with a software technology
  partner who could confidently help them take mobile apps and a cloud platform to
  market. '
case-study-outcome: Within three months, A-Safe had a working RackEye proof of concept
  that could be demo'd at the CEBIT exhibition. The product entailed a mobile app
  for setting up rack sensors in the warehouse, and also a cloud platform for visualising
  damage reports. CEBIT was a huge success, and A-Safe are now confidently taking
  RackEye to market with our help.

A-Safe is a leading Yorkshire based manufacturer of protective barriers for warehouses, airports and other industrial settings. 

Typically, there is a lot of human effort invested in ensuring barriers aren't damaged. Damage typically occurs when a truck collides with a rack or barrier, or when an over-loaded rack starts to buckle.

A-Safe believed they could increase safety and reduce audit costs by using an ingenious combination of electronics and software. Pocketworks were invited to help them take the product to market by developing the mobile apps for iPhone, Android and Windows Phone. And also to build the back-end cloud systems that would store data and allows executives to see reports.

This project is work in progress, see the [RackEye website](http://www.asafe.com/news/post/201/a-safe-introduces-a-revolution-in-rack-protection-at-cemat) for more information.
