case-study-challenge: A-Safe wanted to launch a ground-breaking digital warehouse
  safety solution. Being new to software development, they needed to find with a partner
  who could offer all the advice and skills needed to deliver a result in time for
  their trade exhibitions.
case-study-outcome: We worked with A-Safe to define a mobile and cloud based product
  that would work for their customers. We delivered all software components, and supported
  them through trials and demos at exhibitions.

A-Safe manufacturer barriers that protect warehouse racks. The problem is that impacts with rack can only be spotted manually.
A-Safe believed they could increase safety by using cloud and mobile technology combined with IoT devices.
Since early 2016, we've developed this product from scratch and it has received incredible interest from potential customers.
This project is work in progress, see the [RackEye website](http://www.asafe.com/news/post/201/a-safe-introduces-a-revolution-in-rack-protection-at-cemat) for more information.
