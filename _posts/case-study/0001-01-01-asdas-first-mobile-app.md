On November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe. By 2008, retailers were beginning to explore the potential of this new channel. Tesco were leading the way, and had three apps on the store.

Pocketworks (previously known as Engine Room Apps) approached Asda with a proposal to help them embark on a mobile learning journey. In 2009, Asda's first mobile app was launched - Asda Price Guarantee.
